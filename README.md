## Projet 5 : Produisez une Etude de marche

**Project carried out as part of my data analyst studies**

**Situation**
In this project, we integrated a food company, it specializes in chicken and its products. It now wishes to develop abroad, but its field of possibilities is wide, no country is chosen for the moment and they are all possible.

Our mission is to produce a study that targets certain countries, in order to deepen the market study later.


**Process**
First, I started by cleaning and checking the data in the file ['Data_Cleaning.ipnyb'] which returns a file ready for analysis.

Then, I performed a global analysis of the data, in [Data_Analysis.ipynb'], I first made a generalization study. I then created groups of countries for a better selection, I tested that the groups I created are well distinct.

Finally, I selected some countries and justify this choice.


**Data used and sources**
In this project we will use different data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),

[FAOSTAT_data_9-28-2021_PIB.csv] -- GDP per country and per year
[FAOSTAT_data_9-28-2021_pop.csv] -- Population by country and year
[FAOSTAT_data_9-28-2021_Viande.csv] -- Various information on the amount of food by country and year, specifically for meat.
[FAOSTAT_data_9-28-2021_Nourriture_Total.csv] -- Various information about the amount of food by country and by year, for all food in a country.
